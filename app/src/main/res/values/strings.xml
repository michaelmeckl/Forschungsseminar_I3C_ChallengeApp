    <string name="corona_info_title">Novel COVID-19 (Corona) Virus</string>

    <string name="corona_info_one">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
        \n\nMost people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
        recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical
        problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are
        more likely to develop serious illness.
        \n\nThe best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well
        informed about the COVID-19 virus, the
        disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing
        your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.
        </string>

    <string name="corona_info_two">
        The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose
        when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory
        etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
        \n\nAt this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for
        COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments.
        WHO will continue to provide updated
        information as soon as clinical findings become available.</string>
